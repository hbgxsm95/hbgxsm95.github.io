> “Human Error? No, Bad Design”


## 前言

大概一个月前我在一个与研究生同学的饭局上，跟对方聊起design和psychology的关系，就有点想对这一论题进行研究，同时也是想对这一行业建立一个overall的认识。  基于这个出发点我在豆瓣及其他平台上搜到了Donald Norman和他的一系列设计书籍。 比较有意思的是，国内对其作品译成"设计心理学"，但个人感觉这样的翻译只能打59分， 只差一分就及格的原因是此书确实涉及一点心理学的东西，尤其是memory相关，但不及格的原因是这其实也仅仅是书所涉及内容的冰山一角。 总体来说我觉得这本书还是很推荐的，一方面是让我重新定义了design这一词，另一方面是多多少少向我传递了一些优秀的商业思维。 美中不足的是，书到后面感觉就是作者坐在草坪上跟你漫谈，不过也有可能是作者刻意而为之，毕竟他本人在书中也提到future of book正是如此无需顺序的。

下面正文仅仅是引述我很赞同作者的一些观点，等我读完四部曲后再谈谈自己想法吧。

Note:  很关键一点就是这本书回答了我对design的一个很大疑问：随着时代的发展，究竟什么在变，什么又没有变?  

## 正文

To understand products, it is not enough to understand design or technology: it is critical to understand business. 

**Difference between Discoverability & Understanding**

Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? 

Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean? 



**Major area of Design relevant to the book**

*Industrial design:* 

​	The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer (from the *Industrial Design Society of America’s* website). 

*Interaction design:* 

​	The focus is upon how people interact with tech- nology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction de- sign draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience. 

*Experience design:* 

​	The practice of designing products, processes, ser- vices, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience. 



Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned.



What is a designer to do? Provide as much guidance as possible to ensure that the current state of things is displayed in a coherent and easily interpreted format—ideally graphical 



The design challenge is to present the information about the state of the system (a device, vehicle, plant, or activities being monitored) in a way that is easy to assimilate and interpret, as well as to provide alternative explanations and interpretations 



But if everyone thinks the same way, adding more checks can actually increase the chance of error.



Once people find an explanation for an apparent anomaly, they tend to believe they can now discount it. But explanations are based on analogy with past experiences, experiences that may not apply to the current situation. 



**Error in System Design**

- Understand the causes of error and design to minimize those causes. 
  
- Dosensibilitychecks.Doestheactionpassthe“commonsense”test? 
  
- Make it possible to reverse actions—to “undo” them—or make it 
   harder to do what cannot be reversed. 
   
- Make it easier for people to discover the errors that do occur, and 
   make them easier to correct. 
   
- Don’t treat the action as an error; rather, try to help the person com- 
   plete the action properly. Think of the action as an approximation to what is desired. 
   

Errors in adding fluids to the wrong container can be minimized by making the openings have different sizes and shapes, providing physical constraints against inappropriate filling. 



- **Make the item being acted upon more prominent.** That is, change the appearance of the actual object being acted upon to be more visi- ble: enlarge it, or perhaps change its color. 
  
- **Make the operation reversible.** If the person saves the content, no harm is done except the annoyance of having to reopen the file. If the person elects Don’t Save, the system could secretly save the contents, and the next time the person opened the file, it could ask whether it should restore it to the latest condition. 


The best way of mitigating slips is to provide perceptible feedback about the nature of the action being performed, then very perceptible feedback describing the new resulting state, coupled with a mechanism that allows the error to be undone. 



This metaphor provides two lessons: First, do not try to find “the” cause of an accident; Second, we can decrease accidents and make systems more resilient by designing them to have extra precautions against error (more slices of cheese), less opportunities for slips, 



- Put the knowledge required to operate the technology in the world. Don’t require that all the knowledge must be in the head. Allow for efficient operation when people have learned all the requirements, when they are experts who can perform without the knowledge in the world, but make it possible for non-experts to use the knowledge in the world. This will also help experts who need to perform a rare, infrequently performed operation or return to the technology after a prolonged absence. 
  
- Use the power of natural and artificial constraints: physical, logical, semantic, and cultural. Exploit the power of forcing functions and natural mappings. 
  
- Bridge the two gulfs, the Gulf of Execution and the Gulf of Evaluation. Make things visible, both for execution and evaluation. On the execution side, provide feedforward information: make the options readily available. On the evaluation side, provide feedback: make the results of each action apparent. Make it possible to determine the sys- tem’s status readily, easily, accurately, and in a form consistent with the person’s goals, plans, and expectations. 
  

A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem. 



This process is called *design thinking.* 



Two of the powerful tools of design thinking are human-centered design and the double-diamond diverge-converge model of design. 



an emphasis on two things: solving the right problem, and doing so in a way that meets human needs and capabilities. 



**Four Steps in Design thinking：**

1. *Observation*

Addition to privacy issues, the real problem is that nu- merical correlations say nothing of people’s real needs, of their desires, and of the reasons for their activities 

The debate is not useful. All groups are necessary. Customer research is a tradeoff: deep insights on real needs from a tiny set of people, versus broad, reliable purchasing data from a wide range and large number of people. 

The design specifications must include both factors: marketing and design, buying and using. 



2. *Idea generation / ideation*

Generate numerous ideas. It is dangerous to become fixated upon one or two ideas too early in the process. 

 Be creative without regard for constraints. Avoid criticizing ideas, whether your own or those of others. Even crazy ideas, often obvi- ously wrong, can contain creative insights that can later be extracted and put to good use in the final idea selection. Avoid premature dis- missal of ideas. 

3. *Prototyping*
4. Testing 

Fail frequently, fail fast 



How can we pretend to accommodate all of these very different, very disparate people? The answer is to focus on activities, not the individual person. I 



The American psychologists Charles Carver and Michael Scheier suggest that goals have three fundamental levels that control activities 



Apple’s success was due to its combination of two factors: brilliant design plus support for the entire activity of music enjoyment. 



A major benefit is that if the design requirements are consistent with their activities, people will tolerate complexity and the re- quirements to learn something new 



The traditional design process is linear, sometimes called the *water- fall method* because progress goes in a single direction, and once de- cisions have been made, it is difficult or impossible to go back 



The way to handle the time crunch that eliminates the ability to do good up-front design research is to separate that process from the product team: have design researchers always out in the field, always studying potential products and customers. Then, when the product team is launched, the designers can say, “We already examined this case, so here are our recommendations.” The same argument applies to market researchers. 



In a properly run organization, team members coming from all the various aspects of the product cycle get together to share their requirements and to work harmoniously to design and produce a product that satisfies them, or at least that does so with accept- able compromises. 



Design is a complex activity. But the only way this complex process comes together is if all the relevant parties work together as a team. 

 

Designing for people with special needs is often called *inclusive* or *universal design* 



The best solution to the problem of designing for everyone is flexibility: flexibility in the size of the images on computer screens, in the sizes, heights, and angles of tables and chairs. 



technologies may change, but people stay the same. 



It has to modify its ideas to keep ahead of the competition and come up with a demonstration that excites potential customers and wows potential investors and, more im- portantly, potential distributors of the product. 



Most companies compare features with their competition to determine where they are weak, so they can strengthen those areas. Wrong, argues Moon. A better strategy is to concentrate on areas where they are stronger and to strengthen them even more. Then focus all marketing and advertisements to point out the strong points. This causes the product to stand out from the mindless herd. As for the weaknesses, ignore the irrelevant ones, says Moon. The lesson is simple: don’t follow blindly; focus on strengths, not weaknesses. If the product has real strengths, it can afford to just be “good enough” in the other areas. 



In the twenty-second century, will we still have phones? I predict that although we will still talk with one another over a distance, we will not have any device called a telephone 



How long does it take for an idea to become a product? 



Touch-sensitive displays that could detect the positions of simultaneous finger presses (even if by multiple people) had been in the research laboratories for almost thirty years (these are called multitouch displays). The first devices were developed by the University of Toronto in the early 1980s 



Most startup companies fail, but failure in the high-tech world of California is not considered bad. 



This is sometimes called Stigler’s law: the names of famous people often get attached to ideas even though they had nothing to do with them 



Ideas that are too early often fail, even if eventually others in- troduce them successfully 



A rule of thumb is twenty years from first demonstrations in research laboratories to commercial product, and then a decade or two from first commercial release to widespread adoption. 



These long type arms would of- ten collide and lock together, requiring the typist to separate them manually 



Try education, transportation, medicine, and housing, all of which are overdue for major transformation. 



*The more things change, the more they are the same.* 



In ancient Greece, Plato tells us that Socrates complained about the impact of books, arguing that reliance on written material would diminish not only memory but the very need to think, to debate, to learn through discussion. 



Reliance on technology is a benefit to humanity. With technology, the brain gets neither better nor worse. Instead, it is the task that changes. 



**AS THE WORLD CHANGES, WHAT STAYS THE SAME?** 

With massive change, a number of fundamental principles stay the same. Human beings have always been social beings. Social interaction and the ability to keep in touch with people across the world, across time, will stay with us. The design principles of this book will not change, for the principles of discoverability, of feed- back, and of the power of affordances and signifiers, mapping, and conceptual models will always hold. Even fully autonomous, auto- matic machines will follow these principles for their interactions. Our technologies may change, but the fundamental principles of interaction are permanent.
